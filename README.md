# Justin Schueler's Homepage
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/ATi-lb2GR34
#### Description:
    This is my CS50 final project. I decided to create a webpage that I could use for future purposes, for example getting a job. The overall aesthetic for this website is based off of my vscode color scheme. I also decided to make an underglow for each button which makes it pop even more. When a button is pressed throughout the website the button then turns red momentarily to signify that it was pressed, as it begins to redirect you to the correct page. Each page on the website, except the resume page, include a home button to get back to the home screen easily.

## Index.html
    On the homepage, index.html, I included 5 buttons which are named respectively;About Me, Hobbies, Goals, Contact, and Resume. When you click on a button you are redirected to that page.

## aboutMe.html
    On the About me page, contains basic information about me including where I go to school currently, my major, my plan for next year, my name, my age, and where I am from.

## hobbies.html
    On the hobbies page, I used what I learned from the homepage assigment and put together an accordion to list my hobbies and interests. Which states that my hobbies are learning, solving puzzles, watching anime, playing videogames, and drawing. And the interests portion states that my interests are Astronomy, computers, puzzles, and art. I also included an ordered list to number then and ultimately make my hobbies and interests page look nicer.

## goals.html
    On the goals page, I breifly explain my overall goal, which is to eventually be able to work at NASA. As well as my current education goal which is to be able to achieve a double master's degree in Computer Science and Planetary Science at UC Berkeley. And finally, it states that I plan to work as a Software Engineer or Data Analyst in the meantime as I work my way up to NASA.

## contact.html
    I also made a contact page. This took the longest to implement as I have never made that could send actual messages to an email. Although it took alot of time to figure out how it was done and through countless tries, it ultimately took three lines of code to make it functional, which was suprising to me. Other than that the rest of the contact page is just made up of a form.

## resume.pdf
    And finally my resume page. This page just redirects you to a pdf of my resume. This could be useful when applying for jobs as I made a functional website through what I have learned so far.

#### Conclusion:
    In conclusion, this final project is made up of HTML, for the website building, CSS for the style, and Javascript to be able to change the color of the buttons when pressed.
